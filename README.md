# Stardust version 2.0

This is the second version of my bot, this time it uses RedUtils (C#). It has only 2s/3s logic for now, i will add 1s logic in the future. 
This is still bad since i rewrite it in two weeks for the **RLBot Championship finals**!

I plan to add/change a lot of things in the future and maybe rewrite it completely. *This is a starting point*.
